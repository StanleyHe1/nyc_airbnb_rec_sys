# NYC Airbnb Recommendation System

## Overview

The NYC Airbnb Recommendation System is a project designed to help users find the best Airbnb listings in New York City based on their preferences. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning, the system provides personalized recommendations to enhance the user experience.

**Note**: Due to the limited amount of data available, this recommendation system may not provide the most accurate or comprehensive results. It is intended as a proof of concept and can be improved with access to more extensive datasets.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Analyze Airbnb listings data to extract meaningful insights.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Suggests listings based on user preferences and historical data.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly interface for inputting preferences and viewing recommendations.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Frameworks**: Flask (for web interface, if applicable)
- **Database**: SQLite or other database systems (if applicable)
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Dash (optional)
